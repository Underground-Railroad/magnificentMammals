### [**Mirror**](https://mirror.xyz/dashboard/guide/crowdfunds)

- Anyone can create a Crowdfund by going to the Crowdfunds tab in the Mirror Dashboard and configuring some basic settings.

- A crowdfund can be minimal with only a name and a funding goal, or include a more produced campaign with NFT reward tiers.

- On Mirror, anyone can raise funds for an idea or project using the Crowdfund block. Under the hood, a Crowdfund is a smart contract on Ethereum. Backers deposit ETH to fund your idea in exchange for a token. The token represents a proof of patronage and a stake in the potential success of your project. Crowdfunds can be embedded into any entry on Mirror, alongside text and other media blocks that tell your project's story.

### [Radicle](https://radicle.mirror.xyz/7RDTvdxABVndpZge9VT09Ku5JXD8lCCCpLRRZaVrtJU)
> Funding Open Source to Grow Open Source 

`What is the scope of these grants?`<br>

We are open to funding anything that improves the Radicle ecosystem or the greater FOSS and Web3 community at large. Generally speaking, we have two categories of grants to do so:

`üå± Seed Grants`<br>
+ Seed grants are meant for smaller contributions, both in terms of complexity and cost. These grants are for individuals or small teams looking for less than $50,000 in funding.

+ Applications for seed grants are reviewed by the grants committee on a rolling basis. If accepted, applications are then published publicly in our repositories.

`üå≤ Tree Grants`<br>
+ Tree grants are meant for larger teams, companies, or foundations working on a contribution larger in scope and complexity. They can provide funding from $50,000 - $500,000.

+ Applications for tree grants are reviewed and discussed by the grants committee and community at large on a rolling basis. They may take more time to review.

## Other Stuff

[Panvala](https://panvala.com/)
> Panvala's treasury is a new kind of community-managed endowment‚Äîlike a university endowment. PAN tokens are designed to build this endowment from scratch: the more we share Panvala's treasury, the stronger it gets. By giving communities an economic tool that rivals corporate equity and national currencies, we can shift our society's focus away from corporate life and political life. Let's focus on community life instead.
> + Something I wrote about Panvala: [Panvala a Co Community Exploration](https://discourse.sourcecred.io/t/panvala-a-co-community-exploration/1228) 

[Angel Protocol](https://www.angelprotocol.io/)
> Endowments are the future of giving Less than 60% of charities have enough saved in their reserves to cover more than one year of operating costs. Angel Protocol plays a critical role in solving this challenge.
>
> Endowments are a powerful tool that charities use to grow their donations. However, traditional endowments can be expensive to set up, access, and maintain. Angel Protocol has developed a platform providing easy access to low-risk, high-yield endowments that provide charities financial freedom. Donors give once, and give forever.
