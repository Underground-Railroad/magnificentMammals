> [1] ‚ÄúThe cunning of trauma politics is that it turns actual people and struggles, whether racial or Indigenous citizenship and belonging, into matters of injury. [1] It defines an entire people mostly on their trauma and not by their aspirations or sheer humanity‚Äù. [2] This performance is not for the benefit of Indigenous people, but ‚Äúfor white audiences or institutions of power‚Äù.[2] 

- [1] : trauma politics // first of all when care is being spoken of and it gets political or calls in facets of identity white supremacy is in the room, ableism is often present too. Trauma has become weaponized in the English language and our cultural responses to conflict. We shame around mental health and do the same when it crosses paths in our conflicts be it personal or community. 

  - People who have acquired sharp tongues in regards to racial, trauma or identity politics are often capable of the most harm. I've witnessed what I like to call *"Dominating from the bottom"* - people who are marginalized by compounding identities learn to develop sharp tounges too and have been known to absorb collective energy engaging in identity politics // performative activism. I'm not sure how much this learned defense mechanism is even known to the people acting this way but it translates seamlessly with narcissism. I'm holding this behavior as a trauma response in my current understanding.  

- [2] : The performance piece stands out, think about how much time these conversations take to have about equality, equity, representation...
I find these sorts of things to be a distraction to the bigger issue >> who is present now? 
  + how will they be affected?
  + we need to learn to design for who is present and always adjust when new energy enters the ecosystem.

...Those on the path towards Peace understand that this culture is terribly traumatized in the now and generationally // all identities. . .


[1] Yet conversations about justice have come to be shaped by people who have ever more specific practical advice [1] about fixing the distribution of attention and 
[2] conversational power.[2] Deference practices that serve attention-focused campaigns (e.g. we‚Äôve read too many white men, let‚Äôs now read some people of color) can fail on their own highly questionable terms: [3] attention to spokespeople from marginalized groups could, for example, direct attention away from the need to change the social system that marginalizes them.[3]
 
- [1] : progress happens and there are setbacks too from BIPOC bad actors if you will [folx indoctrinated by white supremacy culture] 
- [2] : conversational power \\ in regards to a redistribution of wealth [thoughts are a currency] the current culture would do well to learn how to actually amplify the voices of marginalized beings who have solutions. = This is what it would look like to leverage power.
- [3] : *"dominating from the bottom"*, when conversations about power, class, status are allowed to dominate conversations about accountability, accessibility, transparency  . . .  

> [4] Elites from marginalized groups can benefit from this arrangement in ways that are compatible with social progress. [4]

- [4] : I feel like a prime example of this. I have no degrees from college and I want to write trauma informed philosophy, lacking accreditation I am collaborating with folks like [Kelly Page, Ph.D](https://twitter.com/drkellypage) The first piece I started jamming on is Narcissism in technology, to demonstrate what is behaviorally happening to people // physiological abuse occurring under the hood of certain algorithms during this global pandemic. Both myself and society can benefit from this arrangement, I get to express my understandings and valid frustrations and everyone gets the social validation they need when they see i'm not alone in my ideology, someone they can relate to has similar beliefs.  [cutting through the social psychological red tape]

> "shaped by people who have ever more specific practical advice"
+ I often witness many things occurring across the spectrum socially here:
  + people identifying as "white" have learned the "right things" to do or say to appear and behave in a politically correct fashion.It‚Äôs usually just signaling through and to often to other folx who identify as ‚Äúwhite‚Äù 
    + blinder: saviorism // folx act in the best interest of others based on rhetoric they have heard primarily from other "white" "woke" people...folx with alphabet pasta behind their names, perhaps or well respected, not often does the advice even come from marginalized groups much less the ones present in the room or better yet those who have not been invited to these ‚Äúhigh content‚Äù conversations.  


> A constructive approach would focus on the pursuit of [1] specific goals or end results [1] rather than avoiding ‚Äúcomplicity‚Äù in injustice or adhering to moral principles. It would be concerned primarily with building institutions and cultivating practices of information-gathering rather than helping. It would focus on accountability rather than conformity. It would calibrate itself directly to the task of redistributing social resources and power rather than to intermediary goals cashed out in terms of pedestals or symbolism. It would focus on building and rebuilding rooms, not regulating traffic within and between them ‚Äì it would be a world-making project: aimed at building and rebuilding actual structures of social connection and movement, rather than mere critique of the ones we already have.

[1] : goals should almost always be = accessibility, transparency, redistribution of power (power present // not all the monsters we can imagine showing up down the road that we try to account for (time waste) in our planning)
What the fvck is power?
Decision creating / influencing / voting
Tooling = grants access to or withholds information on how to use it
