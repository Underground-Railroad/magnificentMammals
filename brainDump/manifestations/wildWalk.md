# What if . . . 

Everyone in the world had a social score relative to thier negative impact?

- buy gas? - ponts
- bank with chase? - points
- litter? - points
- fire someone? - points
- support genocu=ide? - points [I'm looking at the military and police directly here]

## > extracting from your environment will now have negative impacts.

I dream of a world where people operate from a place of choice.

Where everyone wakes up and gets to do what they want to do.

I beleieve there are enough like minded people in the world for people to collaborate on thier dreams.

I believe the history of generational abuse, neglect and trauma is destroying our civilizations humanity.

I pray daily we are not past the point of return.

Fire is errupting from the belly of our mother . . . 

The fetishization of going to the moon is because some folx know were running outta resources.

Depleting this planet.

When I pan out I can see the ways capitalism has taken advantage of many men and women.

Sperm banks and egg centers are merely preparations for repopulation. 

Call it white supremacy, eugenics, the occult, oherwordly, moloch . . . whatever language it takes to register . . . for there is much concern to be had.

These are dark days.

It is understandable for people to feel so deregulated afterall thier realities [identities] are being held hostage. 

### The caste systems that oppress us are constructed by our collective imaginations.
