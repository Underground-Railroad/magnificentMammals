The Ace of Swords feels like a weapon to the destroyed mind, protection to the enlightened mind, survival to the active mind, and tools to the creative mind. The Ace is made of steel and titanium, and holds the power to carve through wood, drill through cement, sand your harshest surface, and open your most concealed truth. The Ace of Swords is your inherited gift.

Your inherited gifts consist of strength, power, and uncanny influence of your spoken word. How will you use them? The Ace of Swords represents an ability to wield powerful influence in your chosen area of work, creation, and existence. This is a time to scream. To choose to fight, and to stand up for the protective, strong, creative weapon that is your
voice.

When Justice prevails, communities on the margins are elevated, yet the oppressor strengthens as it fends to maintain power. We see it in the historyof world domination, as the most intolerant conservatives have risen during times of human resilience. Renaming it civil disobedience, civil unrest is a necessary step in ending systems rooted in racism, misogyny, ableism, homophobia, and hate.

Justice is connecting to the root of a movement, and fully practicing what you believe in. Justice is accountability. 

Justice is a rowdy party of truth and love and challenges and humanity. It's the lesson you learn now; as it affects the lifetime you experience.

Justice isn't about balance, but about a passionate attack on hate and prejudice. It's about elevating the voices on the margins rather than speaking for them.

Justice asks you to practice your gut reaction, your radical response to injustice and hone the behind your black, brown, queer, magical, offbeat, or sometimes disregarded body. 

Justice is self-love against the odds. 

Justice is the march where you were finally able to say I'm here, I'm
queer, and I'm not fucking buying it. 

Justice is letting go of toxic affiliations that erased your personal power; while being accountable to your role in them. Justice is sharing that power with those who need it.

Justice is asking yourself the questions that will cleanse your conscience or otherwise let you breathe.

What ancient power structures exist in your life because of tradition or history, but challenge Justice?

Why do we forgive others for being unaware or dismissive of our struggle? Why am I here; at this gathering, at this demonstration, in this movement, in this mind? Am I reclaiming a movement that is mine? Am I capitalizing off it? Is my heart present? Am I being used? Tokenized? Am I safe?

Justice is finding a space where you can expect safety in wisdom. Justice is asking once, and being held by the community that surrounds you at that moment.

Justice is when you understand historical power
structures, you own your mistakes, and you navigate your privilege with awareness and compassion.

Justice is knowing the feeling of home. Knowing you are worth your breath, receiving validation, and having full authority over your body.


Justice is fabulous and she wants you present for her
revolution.
