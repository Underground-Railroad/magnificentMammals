> Social Awareness [and shadow] visually articulated by Aloysious

Sessions with me Surface unresolved internal to external conflict, allowing for for the opening of of dialog and possibility of surfacing unaddressed needs.

The work I do is in an effort to raise an individual's social social, emotional, and environmental awareness.

I believe we are all products of our environment. 
Our social ethics are encoded by various enviornmental elements such as //

- early childhood development through adulthood
- housing [physiological-health safety]
- educational experience 
- health 
- sexual reproductive education 
- power / relationship dynamics
- citezenship
- military / religious affiliation
- *to name a few*

I relate with individuals to surface whatever parts of thier identities / lived experiences need attention. Time is not linear, the work we do in the present may also tend to emotional labor that was never supported in the past. 

I empower individuals by sharing social tools which allow them to stand more authentically in thier being. 

My guiding principles are // 
- Autonomy 
- Consent 
- Boundaries
- Neurodiversity 
- Decolonization 

I am self educated in the realm of Neurodiversity, Decolonization and Ethics. 

The relationships I develop are the only credentials I find relative in my time of living.
