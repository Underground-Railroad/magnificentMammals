## Ecosystems

`Playtime` (wednesdays / fridays @ 10am)
> Play Time is a space for Creddies to connect through movement and silliness. It is collaborative, spacious, and accepting. We spend so much time sitting in front of a screen, so let’s get in our bodies! Sometimes we’ll pretend to be animals; sometimes we’ll do deep breathing exercises -- it all depends on what you need. Come on in and nourish your body and heart.
