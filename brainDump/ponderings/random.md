Money taught me...<br>

People can be out of alignment with their integrity when operating from a place of scarcity. 

English is like Legos for manifesting oppression, building blocks...choose your own adventure. Cast spells of avoidance. Beings perpetuate violence through verbal propaganda...sharing identity politics, rhetoric amongst small like minded groups, then they validate eachothers actions so even if one person says no everyone else hears 6 people saying yes....the hive mind. Oi. 

Autonomy and agency are lost concepts to people with a threatened sense of security. 

Loyalties - developed out of need. This happens in war, these are called "allies". This is why that language does not fly in my house. 

People don't know what parts of thought or systems to acce to map their urroundings and themselves.

More to follow....
