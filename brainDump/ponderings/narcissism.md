> And how to spot each one - Kim Mia - Jul 15, 2020

### 1 — Grandiose Narcissist
`“I’m better than you, and I know it”`
- This is your classic arrogant and attention-seeking narcissist. They are entitled, preoccupied with success, and jealous of other people.

- Often misusing or exploiting relationships for one’s own benefit, they will gaslight you to doubt your own feelings and intuitions.

- They seem blatant about their self-centered behavior, need to be in the spotlight, and get uncomfortable when they’re not.
These people use their empathy to tune in to what pleases you, and in doing so, they find validation.

### 2 — Malignant Narcissist
`“I will do whatever it takes to get what I want.”`
- Contrary to the “grandiose narcissist”, these individuals don’t do anything for your benefit. They will lash out at, or attempt to destroy other people in order to prop up his or her fragile sense of self.

- While there is a difference between narcissists and psychopaths, this category of narcissists has a tendency to lean more towards psychopathy more so than any other type of narcissist.

- They still do feel some degree of guilt and shame when breaking rules whereas a psychopath will not feel any.

### 3 — Covert Narcissist
`“I’m a great artist but the world never noticed my talent.”`
- This one can be trickier to spot than other types of narcissists because the person isn’t always obvious about their disorder. Suggested by the name, this type of narcissist is someone who has has a hidden layer of narcissistic traits.

- Deeply self-absorbed, these individuals feel chronically victimized, as though the world has failed to recognize their brilliance.

- Often misdiagnosed as depression, their concealed confidence makes it difficult to recognize their narcissistic traits at first sight. They are passive-aggressive, hypersensitive to criticism, and truly believe that the world never got their greatness.

- At first encounter, they may even seem like that friend who lacks confidence and needs a boost but the key indicator of their narcissism is the arrogance along with their failure. 

- They don’t take ownership of what they did wrong and always blame the world for them not succeeding.

### 4 — Communal Narcissist
`“Look at all the great things I’ve done for the world!”`
- First proposed in a 2012 research paper, this subtype of narcissism refers to individuals who get their validation from community-related aspects of life, such as helpfulness, and philanthropy.

- This is the person who has countless photos on their social media of them getting all dressed up and going to charity events and galas.

- They are always showing off their great deeds for the world but have an instant need to talk about it. They seek a lot of validation for their “good work”.

- They even seem to have a lack of empathy for the people they are trying to help and rather feel above them.

- If we want to do a good deed, we do it quietly. We do it because we know it’s the right thing to do. But a communal narcissist does it for show. A narcissist only cares for their image in the eyes of the world, rather than how they make everyone else feel.
