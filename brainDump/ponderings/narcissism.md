## [4 Types of Narcissists You Need to Know About](https://medium.com/invisible-illness/4-types-of-narcissists-you-need-to-know-about-ae5ec5fad45e) 
> And how to spot each one - Kim Mia - Jul 15, 2020

### 1 ‚Äî Grandiose Narcissist
`‚ÄúI‚Äôm better than you, and I know it‚Äù`
- This is your classic arrogant and attention-seeking narcissist. They are entitled, preoccupied with success, and jealous of other people.

- Often misusing or exploiting relationships for one‚Äôs own benefit, they will gaslight you to doubt your own feelings and intuitions.

- They seem blatant about their self-centered behavior, need to be in the spotlight, and get uncomfortable when they‚Äôre not.
These people use their empathy to tune in to what pleases you, and in doing so, they find validation.

### 2 ‚Äî Malignant Narcissist
`‚ÄúI will do whatever it takes to get what I want.‚Äù`
- Contrary to the ‚Äúgrandiose narcissist‚Äù, these individuals don‚Äôt do anything for your benefit. They will lash out at, or attempt to destroy other people in order to prop up his or her fragile sense of self.

- While there is a difference between narcissists and psychopaths, this category of narcissists has a tendency to lean more towards psychopathy more so than any other type of narcissist.

- They still do feel some degree of guilt and shame when breaking rules whereas a psychopath will not feel any.

### 3 ‚Äî Covert Narcissist
`‚ÄúI‚Äôm a great artist but the world never noticed my talent.‚Äù`
- This one can be trickier to spot than other types of narcissists because the person isn‚Äôt always obvious about their disorder. Suggested by the name, this type of narcissist is someone who has has a hidden layer of narcissistic traits.

- Deeply self-absorbed, these individuals feel chronically victimized, as though the world has failed to recognize their brilliance.

- Often misdiagnosed as depression, their concealed confidence makes it difficult to recognize their narcissistic traits at first sight. They are passive-aggressive, hypersensitive to criticism, and truly believe that the world never got their greatness.

- At first encounter, they may even seem like that friend who lacks confidence and needs a boost but the key indicator of their narcissism is the arrogance along with their failure. 

- They don‚Äôt take ownership of what they did wrong and always blame the world for them not succeeding.

### 4 ‚Äî Communal Narcissist
`‚ÄúLook at all the great things I‚Äôve done for the world!‚Äù`
- First proposed in a 2012 research paper, this subtype of narcissism refers to individuals who get their validation from community-related aspects of life, such as helpfulness, and philanthropy.

- This is the person who has countless photos on their social media of them getting all dressed up and going to charity events and galas.

- They are always showing off their great deeds for the world but have an instant need to talk about it. They seek a lot of validation for their ‚Äúgood work‚Äù.

- They even seem to have a lack of empathy for the people they are trying to help and rather feel above them.

- If we want to do a good deed, we do it quietly. We do it because we know it‚Äôs the right thing to do. But a communal narcissist does it for show. A narcissist only cares for their image in the eyes of the world, rather than how they make everyone else feel.

## *7 Inner Child Archetypes*
¬†**as defined by Dr. LePera in her book,¬†*How to Do the Work:***

**The caretaker:**¬†Typically comes from codependent dynamics.¬† Gains a sense of identity and self-worth through neglecting their own needs.¬† Believes that the only way to receive love is to cater to others and ignore their own needs.

**The overachiever:**¬†Feels seen, heard, and valued through success and achievement.¬† Uses external validation as a way to cope with low self-worth.¬† Believes that the only way to receive love is through achievement.

**The underachiever**¬†Keeps themselves small, unseen, and beneath their potential due to the fear of criticism or shame of failure.¬† Takes themselves out of the emotional game before it‚Äôs ever played.¬† Believes that the only way to receive love is to stay invisible.

**The rescuer/protector:**¬†Ferociously attempts to rescue those around them in an attempt to heal from their own vulnerability, especially childhood.¬† Views others as helpless, incapable, and dependent and derives their love and self-worth from being in a position of power.¬† Believes that the only way to receive love is to help others by focusing on their wants and needs and helping to solve their problems.

**The life of the party:**¬†This is the always happy and cheerful comedic person who never shows pain, weakness, or vulnerability.¬† It‚Äôs likely that this inner child was shamed for their emotional state.¬† Believes the only way to feel okay and receive love is to make sure that everyone around them is happy.

**The yes-person:**¬†Drops everything and neglects all needs in the service of others.¬† Was likely modeled self-sacrifice in childhood and engaged in deep codependency patterns, much as the caretaker did.¬† Believes that the only way to receive love is to be both good and selfless.

**The hero-worshipper:**¬†Needs to have a person or guru to follow.¬† Likely emerges from an inner child wound made by a caretaker who was perceived superhuman, without faults.¬† Believes that the only way to receive love is to reject their own needs and desires and view others as a model to learn how to live.

Each type of inner child archetype has one thing in common:¬†**they were born from broken connections and unmet emotional needs.**
