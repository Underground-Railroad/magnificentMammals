# Trauma Informed Social and Organizational Design

> random thoughts on the matter // pertaining to web3 + DAO's but also life // bringing personal ideology to the surface 
> [through my autism]
>
> If you learn from me : Cite me // lineage is important // gratitude is a practice

### T O O L I N G
+ tech used = map out
+ what technology has permissions that need to br granted to others? are there variations to the 
+ who has the "power" to decentralize this "power"?

### D I S C O R D

+ flashing shvt = üö´ [ resist the temptation = Neurodivergence ]
  + emojis, giphys, server logos, emails etc
+ transparency
  + define // model
  + what does it look like? what about if it is not present? examples of each.
+ roles // communication streams
  + personal preferences / sensitivities / accomodations
+ power // dissolution of [programs/ comms / organization / scheduling / notifications]
+ implicit bias // conditioned competitiveness [ re: incentives / rewards ]

### C O L L A B O R A T I O N

+ workflows / guides
+ standards of practice
  + re: quality // define [should be based on accessibility / ADA standards]
  + time to get creative and push back on Acedemia / Ableism
+ working groups // size [individual to collective ü•Ñ count]
+ planning // organization // tooling based on aesthetics and ergonomics per person
+ implicit bias // conditioned competitiveness [ re: power // leadership // fear of heiarchies overcorrection : lack of structure, loss of continuity, hoarding]

### M E N T A L + H E A L T H

+ consent = wtf is it? can it be defined?
  + in the same swing, can harm be identified? [not without a trauma lens]
+ boundaries = what are they?
  + are there collective boundaries?
+ implicit bias // power dynamics = coping methods for activations
+ implicit bias // identity politics = coping methods for activations
+ implicit bias // capitalism = coping methods for activations
+ can ableism be identified in encounters? [conditioned social residue from üñçÔ∏èsupremacy culture]
+ checking-in // groups // personal life // balancing time
  + when to [ occassions that call for a check-in ]
  + what does a check-in entail?
+ creating personal community
  + echo chambers [what are we doing to counter them] // personal accountability
  + self care // rituals [individual // collective]

### S E L F + G O V E R N A N C E 

+ leading with consent in all regards
+ ability to articulate / communicate and stay grounded in ones boundaries
+ ability to identify between wants and needs
+ ability to prioritize the autonomy of others over the urge to influence or manipulate the outcome of our desires.
+ personal accountability
  + trauma work // identifying shadows and blindspots
  + knowing the ways we react / cope / process / integrate
  + knowing what our needs are // because we need to be able to advocate for them
  + if theres things about us that we want people to know about communicating / relating with us how do we share this information // is there a way to signal to the group? = [ü•Ñ count]

### R I T U A L S

+ decolonizing my mind [ this is a lifetime journey ]
+ questioning my thoughts // behavior // ideology >> lastly, my environment
+ breaking down generational trauma with my daughter
+ tending to the senses of survival
+ gratitude
  + personal messages to folx in my sphere
  + letters of reccomendation
  + sharing peoples stories // visions with others {with obtained consent}
  + props channel @sourcecred
  + praise channel @TEC
+ walks // nature // picking up garbage
+ tarot
+ praying
+ touching a tree EVERY single day // coregulating
+ N O T I C I N G = curating this gift

### N E U R O D I V E R I S I T Y + T E C H

+ notifications // anxiety
  + methods to address certain habits / avoidance
+ behaviors that alarm nervous systems in a server
+ examples of narcissism observed in discord
+ nervous system regulation
+ autonomy
+ disassociating
  + getting grounded // many methods for
  + identifying old habits // patterns

**N O R M A L I Z E**
+ screens / voice / participation = always optional [ü™∞'s' on the wall are welcome]
+ asking for consent
+ listening
+ gratitude
+ radical inclusion [all hands in = throw out identity politics, they obliterate the possibility for collaboration]
+ talking about things that make you uncomfortable
+ spaces for identity representation {I've seen a server with a channel to share pictures of the üêà‚Äç‚¨õ's everyone has}
+ permissionless entry [accessibility over insecurity]
+ mentorship
+ skill building
+ group participation // teach many as opposed to one
+ elliminate single points of failure
+ know the tools in your ecosysytem, shift with the evolution of tech, do your research:
  + acknowledge = [cite sources/ lineage], adopt/prepare to adapt, critique, experiment, survey, iterate, fine tune
+ always seek feedback and critique in every endevaor // grit grows in these spaces
+ situational awareness // share with the rest of the class
+ more thoughts later..................
