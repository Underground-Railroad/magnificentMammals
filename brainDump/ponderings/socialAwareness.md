## What nodes define the outcome of social awareness?
+ Brain development // not to be confused with age and the correlation to maturity ( social constructs / biological, environmental factors)

+ en¬∑vi¬∑ron¬∑ment `biological` 
  + toxins in ecosysytem >> can be absorbed, felt, inhaled, heard, seen, tasted
+ en¬∑vi¬∑ron¬∑ment `psychological`

## Born into oblivion
> Bless this phase of life, newborns enter the scene.

Being born into oblivion one is unaware of and unable to provide for defend or advocate for themselves.<br> 
This period takes place from birth to early youth, the awakinging to sourroundings happens between 3 - 7 years old on average. The harsher the environment the quicker a child usually appears to develop. (masking starts young) Children born Neurotypical can quickly shift to Neurodivergent based on the environments their brains have access to and are cultivated in.

> In a social justice context, oppression is what happens when individuals or groups of people are discriminated against or otherwise treated unjustly, whether by the government, private organizations, individuals, or other groups. (The word comes from the Latin root "opprimere," which means "pressed down.") 

The following categories describe patterns of behavior and not necessarily belief systems. `A person can have strong beliefs in favor of social equality and still practice oppression through their actions`.üëÄ In many cases, these categories of oppression overlap in such a way that one person can potentially deal with multiple forms of oppression and privilege at the same time. The experience of multiple and differing forms of oppression is described by the term "intersectionality."

+ `ableism` = systemic and systematic discrimination against alter-abled or ‚Äúdisabled‚Äù people. // a social pattern in which people who are disabled are treated differently, to an unnecessary degree, than those who are not. This could take the form of either not accommodating those with physical or mental disabilities or treating them as if they are unable to live without assistance. >> Write up a side paper on "accidental" ( conditioned ) ableism // people need it parsed down

+ `adultism` = systemic and systematic prejudice and discrimination against young people and children.

+ `ageism` = systemic and systematic discrimination against persons of an older age group. // a social pattern in which people of a certain chronological age are treated differently, to an unnecessary degree, than those who are not. One example is Hollywood's unspoken "expiration date" for women, a date beyond which it is difficult to get work because a person is no longer considered young and/or attractive. 

+ `antisemitism` = systemic and systematic prejudice and discrimination towards Jewish people.

+ `alloism` = systemic and systematic prejudice and discrimination against people who are asexual.

+ `capitalism` = an economic and political system in which a country's trade and industry are controlled by private owners for profit, rather than by the state. (or people)

+ `castesiem`- systematic or systematic oppression, discrimination based on one‚Äôs caste // one-sided loyalty in favour of a particular caste. Casteism leads the members of one caste to exploit the members of other caste for their own vested interest in the name of superiority or inferiority.

+ `classism` = systemic and systematic prejudice and discrimination based on social or economic class. // Classism is held in place by a system of beliefs and cultural attitudes that ranks people according to economic status, family lineage, job status, level of education, and other divisions.

+ `cisgenderism [transphobia] / Cisnormativity` = Cisgenderism or cisnormativity is a form of oppression that assumes that everyone who is assigned male at birth exists as a man and everyone who is assigned female at birth exists as a woman. Cisgenderism discriminates against and does not take into account people who do not identify with their assigned sex at birth, and the gender roles associated with them or those who do not have clearly defined or binary gender roles (binary transgender people or nonbinary transgender people).

+ `colorism/shadeism` = a form of systemic and systematic prejudice or discrimination in which people are treated differently based on the social meanings attached to favoring lighter skin color (distinct from racism, but derived from white supremacy) // a social pattern in which people are treated differently based on the amount of visible melanin in the skin. A number of studies show that lighter-skinned Black Americans or Latinos receive preferential treatment over their darker-skinned counterparts. Colorism is not the same thing as racism, but the two tend to go together.

+ `colonialism` = in the U.S. context, this is a form of systemic and systematic prejudice and discrimination against Indigenous people or Native Americans (like other forms of oppression, it intersects with racism and other -isms). // a social pattern in which people who are born in a given country are treated differently from those who immigrate to it, usually to the benefit of a specific identifiable group of powerful immigrants. This involves a process of powerful immigrants overtaking the country and holistically exploiting its resources.

+ `ethnocentrism` = systemic and systematic prejudice or discrimination against people who do not speak English as a first language.

+ `heterosexism` = systemic and systematic prejudiced attitude or discriminatory practices against homosexuals and Queer-identified people. // Heterosexism describes the pattern in which people are assumed to be heterosexual. Since not everybody is heterosexual, the outliers may be punished with ridicule, restriction of partnership rights, discrimination, arrest, and even death.

+ `jingoism` = an extreme form of patriotism that often calls for violence toward people who were not born in the U.S.

+ `lookism` = systemic and systematic discrimination or prejudice based on a person‚Äôs physical appearance, often based on the media‚Äôs presentation and definition of beauty. // a social pattern in which people whose faces and/or bodies fit social ideals are treated differently from people whose faces and/or bodies do not. Standards of beauty vary from culture to culture, but just about every human society has them.

+ `saneism` = a form of systemic and systematic discrimination and oppression based on a diagnosis or the perception of someone having been diagnosed with a psychiatric condition.

+ `nativism` = the policy and attitude of protecting the interests of native-born or established inhabitants against those of immigrants. // a social pattern in which people who are born in a given country are treated differently from those who immigrate to it, to the benefit of natives. 

+ `racism` = systemic and systematic discrimination or prejudice based on race; the idea that whiteness is superior and therefore has the right to dominate another race or races. // Whereas bigotry means having an intolerance for people of other races and religions, racism assumes that those from other races are actually genetically inferior human beings. Racism acts on this belief with political, systemic, social, and institutional power. Power is necessary to operationalize racism. Without it, beliefs of genetic inferiority are simply prejudice. Racism has prevailed throughout human history as a justification for a host of oppressive actions.

+ `religious` imperialism = systemic and systematic prejudice or discrimination against people who practice religions other than Christianity.

+ `sexism` = or the belief that cisgender men are superior to cisgender women on the basis of sex, has been an almost universal condition of civilization. Whether rooted in biology or culture or both, sexism tends to force women into subservient, restrictive roles that many do not want, and to force men into dominant, competitive roles that many do not want.

+ `sizeism [Fatphobia]` = systemic and systematic prejudice or discrimination based on a person‚Äôs size. //a social pattern in which people whose bodies fit social ideals are treated differently from people whose bodies do not. In contemporary Western society, people with a slender build are generally considered more attractive than people who are heavy.

+ `speciesism`- systematic and systematic discrimination or prejudice against the plant and animal kingdom // the assumption of human superiority leading to the exploitation of animals.


## Influential systems 
> Anthropologists, (quantitative) historians, and sociologists have proposed a variety of explanations for the collapse of civilizations involving causative factors such as `environmental change`, `depletion of resources`, `unsustainable complexity`, invasion, `disease`, `decay of social cohesion`, `rising inequality`, `secular decline of cognitive abilities`, loss of creativity, and misfortune [(*wiki*)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Societal_collapse)

`environmental change`- [*wiki*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Environmental_change)
+  is a change or disturbance of the environment most often caused by human influences and natural ecological processes. Environmental changes include various factors, such as natural disasters, human interferences, or animal interaction. Environmental change encompasses not only physical changes, but also factors like an infestation of invasive species

`depletion of resources`- [*wiki*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resource_depletion)
+ is the consumption of a resource faster than it can be replenished. Natural resources are commonly divided between renewable resources and non-renewable resources (see also [mineral resource classification](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mineral_resource_classification)). Use of either of these forms of resources beyond their rate of replacement is considered to be resource depletion.The value of a resource is a direct result of its availability in nature and the cost of extracting the resource, the more a resource is depleted the more the value of the resource increases. There are several types of resource depletion, the most known being: Aquifer depletion, deforestation, mining for fossil fuels and minerals, pollution or contamination of resources, slash-and-burn agricultural practices, soil erosion, and overconsumption, excessive or unnecessary use of resources.
