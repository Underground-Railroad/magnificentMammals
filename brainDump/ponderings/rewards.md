`dopamine's role in reward` 

+ Neurons that release dopamine are activated when we expect to receive a reward. Dopamine also enhances reward-related memories. It strengthens synapses ‚Äî the junctions where neurons pass messages ‚Äî in the brain's learning and memory center, the hippocampus. // Rewards are defined as those objects, which we will work to acquire through allocation of time, energy, or effort; that is, any object or goal that we seek <br>

> Memory is an essential element to adaptive behavior since it allows consolidation of past experience guiding the subject to consider them in future experiences. Among the endogenous molecules that participate in the consolidation of memory, including the drug-seeking reward, considered as a form of learning, is dopamine. This neurotransmitter modulates the activity of specific brain nucleus such as nuclei accumbens, putamen, ventral tegmental area (VTA), among others and synchronizes the activity of these nuclei to establish the neurobiological mechanism to set the hedonic element of learning. We review the experimental evidence that highlights the activity of different brain nuclei modulating the mechanisms whereby dopamine biases memory towards events that are of motivational significance.<br>
  
üìù  [Dopamine in motivational control: rewarding, aversive, and alerting](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3032992/)<br>
> Some dopamine neurons encode motivational value, supporting brain networks for seeking, evaluation, and value learning. Others encode motivational salience, supporting brain networks for orienting, cognition, and general motivation. Both types of dopamine neurons are augmented by an alerting signal involved in rapid detection of potentially important sensory cues. We hypothesize that these dopaminergic pathways for value, salience, and alerting cooperate to support adaptive behavior.
> The neurotransmitter dopamine (DA) has a crucial role in motivational control ‚Äì in learning what things in the world are good and bad, and in choosing actions to gain the good things and avoid the bad things.<br>

> Dopamine (DA) is a key neurotransmitter modulating essential functions of the central nervous system (CNS), like voluntary movement, reward, several cognitive functions and goal-oriented behaviors. // Here we present an overview of the current knowledge on the involvement of DAergic receptors in the regulation of key physiological brain activities, and the consequences of their dysfunctions in brain disorders such as PD, schizophrenia and addiction.
