# Diversity and Inclusion 

If you would like to grok diversity a simple way of perciving it is such // 

imagine if you will 1 human being in a room....if you were to add one more person there would be more diversity present. 

THE COLOR OF SOMEONES SKIN DOES NOT QUANTIFY THIER INHERENT PRESENCE OF DIVERSITY

we are all diverse like fingerprints we all have unique makeups. 


If you want to design for diversity you have to design for who is present. 

what are the needs of all presrent? design for that

when new people join ask them if they need more than what is present to feel belonging.

STOP designing spaces for people who are not present.
