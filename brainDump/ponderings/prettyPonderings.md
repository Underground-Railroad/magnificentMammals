> Neuroplasticity is something I have dabbled in since I was a child. I have made a hobby sport at the adaptability of my noodle. <br>
> In all it's imperfections I am gifted with the ability to draw wisdom from my environment and ancestral knowledge, [we are all capable of this however not everyone has access = oppression muffles these abilities] I cannot take credit for all I know...I will cite my sources along the way. <br>
> This is small a collection of thoughts I enjoy reflecting on. <br>
> [It will grow as I have time / space]

<h1 align="center">I am intentionally influencing counter culture</h1>

> Manifestation is real. The future is what we say it is, as is the present and apparently if youre wealthy enough you can even shape the narrative of history. I am very intentional about every single word that leaves my lips. I have spent over a decade being mindful and the last three years deep in the Decolonization process of clearing my mind of toxins from my environment. I am learning to walk and talk The Great Law of Peace. English was constructed for genocide it is the linuistic tool of such a beast. It takes great effort to not utilize the art of war we have all been taught by our whit supremacy environments.

`i` am trying to not<br>
make you pay for their mistakes<br>
i `am` trying to teach myself<br>
you are not `responsible`<br>
`for` the wound<br>
how can i punish you<br>
for what you have not done<br>
you wear `my emotions`<br>
like a decorated army vest<br>
you are not cold or<br>
savage or hungry<br>
you are medicinal<br>
you are not them<br>

## *A note on shadow*

When people expect the worse in one another they enter an energetic realm where the only energy expelled will be exhibited behaviorally in the worst manifetsations of themselves. <br>
That's just the math of magic.
