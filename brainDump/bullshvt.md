## Miami Mayor Wants Elon Musk To Build A Tunnel Under The City
> "We here at the Richest like to give it to ya straight.  So we wanna tell you up front, todayâ€™s video is gonna be boring.  No, no, no!  Not THAT kind of boring!  Come on now.  We mean boring as in Elon Muskâ€™s The Boring Company!  They specialize in creating some of the finest tunnels the world has ever seen!  In case you didnâ€™t know, these are the guys behind the tunnels that currently run right underneath the Las Vegas Convention Center.  And theyâ€™ve only been recently completed, and are already beloved by the people of Las Vegas.  But get this, one mayor in particular has his eye set firmly on Muskâ€™s company, as well asâ€¦ undergroundâ€¦ and he has big plans for the city of Miami.  Ideally, he wants Mr. Musk to bore a hole right underneath Miami to alleviate some of the horrendous traffic congestion-- and he wants the federal government to pay for it.  Look, get it.  Right now traffic there is bad.  REAL bad.  People have been complaining for years about the ridiculous amount of traffic.  Weâ€™d even go so far as to say that it has deterred people from moving to Miami over the years!  But with one of Mr. Muskâ€™s shiny new tunnels, travel time for commuters would be reduced from a headache inducing 40 minutesâ€¦ to a speedy five minutes.  Now that ainâ€™t bad, folks.  So, get ready for us to dig deep, and get to the bottom of this one.  Weâ€™ve got the scoop on this story right hereâ€¦. So stick around."
