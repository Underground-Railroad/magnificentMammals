> My friend sarah...she's got a voice like an angel...she found out that every sound has a geometrical shape to it....we want to figure out how to manifest these shapes w/tech while she's letting her pipes loose...we think she's drawing pictures with her sounds and wanna see what it looks like. Got any leads on how to pull this off?

[Octopus] : That's pretty cool! Depending on exactly what you have in mind, there are some options: 
1. You could just record to a basic program like Audacity, which will show the waveform. <br>

2. There are off-the -shelf audio visualizers that might or might not do what you want, <br>

3. like https://inspirationfeed.com/music-visualizers/ <br>

4. We could work to build a custom visualizer using Processing (it's been about 5 years since I've played with this) <br>
- basically take the audio signal, convert it to a number in some way, use that number to generate or change some aspect of a visual. <br>
