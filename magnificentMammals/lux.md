> **I identify as a queer, non-binary, radical, magical being of mixed European descent.**
>
> Although my heart has many homes, I am currently lucky to live on the lush ancestral lands of the Duwamish People, in the place also known as Seattle, Washington. (If you live here as well, consider paying Real Rent to the traditional stewards of this land)
>
> I am in the humble practice of dedicating my life in service to a future rooted in a culture of consent, collective care, and systems that support all life. I understand this practice to involve an ongoing commitment to shifting existing power structures in myself and in the wider world.
>
> I intend to live in way that centers our human-ness and relationships with each other, and to honor this commitment, I openly welcome feedback on how I could better show up for you and hold space for the identities you carry in any spaces that I facilitate.
> 
> I am deeply inspired by the work and words of adrienne maree brown, Joanna Macy, Tyson Yunkaporta, and Robin Wall Kimmerer, among many others. I honor the long lineages that precede me in all of my areas of practice.
