Incentivizing Actions That Increase and Maintain Native Ecosystems Through Tokenization

### Problems With Regenerative Marketplaces

Narrowly Focused on Carbon Credits
> Currently actions that increase and maintain native ecosystems are incentivized to do so primarily through carbon credits. However, these actions often have beneficial impacts in more ecosystem services than just carbon sequestration. 



One time Measurement and Verification
> The measurement and verification of these actions are often done only one time. Over time the cumulative impacts to ecosystem services from these actions add up and are unable to be assessed accurately in one pass over. 

Lack of Community Standards
> The assessment methodologies for regenerative actions are often controlled by a centralized organization. This organization says if the assessment technique is appropriate or not often without seeking continual community feedback. This feedback is not only necessary for ensuring that the assessment technique is appropriate but also for social equity and participation. 

Economic incentives
> Once a carbon credit is paid for and paid for, often the organization or individual that the money goes to does not receive continued support. In order for the organization or individual to continue to carry out sustainable actions, they need to be continually incentivized. 

Inconsistent valuation with no value exchange possible
> The different regenerative activities and their benefits to the world are inconsistently valued. This makes it hard for people to realize what regenerative activity should be done, where, and at what time period. Funders of regenerative activities primarily receive carbon credits in return for funding the regenerative action. This lacks the ability to show impact on soil health, water quality, and other ecosystem service benefits. Without credits for each of these ecosystem benefits one cannot exchange the carbon credits for soil health credits etc. 
 
To sum this all up, the ability to sustainably coordinate, monitor, and incentivize multiple ecosystem-specific regenerative activities in a unified manner, at a global scale, 

does not exist…

## How We Will Solve These Problems

A regenerative marketplace that sustainably coordinates, monitors, and incentivizes multiple ecosystem-specific regenerative activities in a unified manner, at a global scale. 

Beyond Carbon Credits

> This regenerative marketplace pays for the activity to be done, it’s focus is not on the additional benefits from that action such as carbon sequestration. Once an activity is paid for, a permanent digital record of this is created. This record contains information about the activity, the measurement and verification methods, and funding amount channeled towards the activity. The record can be sold as is, without the action it paid for being measured and verified. The holder of this record could also wait for the action to become measured and verified. After that, they can hold it or wait longer. If they wait longer, data on the additional benefits from this action will accumulate; such as data about the actions impact on carbon sequestration, soil health, water quality, etc. This data can increase the value of that digital record, NFT.

Continued Measurement and Verification
> By continually assessing the impacts of the regenerative actions, a more accurate estimation on impact to carbon, soil, etc. is able to be delivered. These impacts accumulate over time. This marketplace would pay for automated measurement and verification techniques to be carried out for the regenerative actions. These techniques could include satellite imagery, smart technology (sensors), and or boots on the ground.

Constantly Seeking Community Feedback
> The entire marketplace would be run by DAOs. A global governance DAO as well as different sector DAOs (such as forest, ocean, tundra, etc.). Sector DAOs would be composed of leading scientific experts. When a implementer of a regenerative action wants to get funding to implement the action they would propose it to Akorn. This proposal would include what the action is, where it would be implemented, how the action would be measured and verified, and the cost for the implementer to implement that action. The DAO(s) would then vote to determine if that action is appropriate, if the area of implementation is a priority, if the cost is correct, and that the measurement and verification techniques adhere to community standards. As new actions are proposed, more measurement and verification techniques can be created and updated to work with community standards. By quantifying the priority areas for action implementation according to community feedback, these actions can have more equitable social impact. 

Perpetual Funding
> The digital record containing information about regenerative actions can be traded in an NFT marketplace or the NFT itself can be traded in a marketplace for tokens. Each time the NFT (or tokens) is traded a percentage of that trade goes towards accumulating resources. These resources are then channeled back to further support the implementers of the regenerative action to implement more actions. This provides continued support for the implementers we onboard onto the marketplace. 

Cross Benefit Exchanging and Appropriate Valuation Determined by the Market
> Once an action is verified to have been completed, the additional benefits from that action start to accrue. An NFT holds information about these benefits and the action itself. At any point in time the holder of that NFT can exchange it for tokens. These tokens are based on the action itself (100 trees recorded planted: 100 tree tokens) or the additional benefits from that action (carbon sequestered, soil nutrients retained, etc.). These tokens are able to be traded in the wider crypto marketplace and from this have a value as determined by the market.  

## The Open Source Tools We are Creating

Needed Components
> Most of the components below will need a front and smart contracts

DAO
> Roles of a DAO would be to:
+ Vote on new features
+ Select projects to be funded (KYC..Etc)
+ Select the appropriate measurement and verification techniques for the project funded
+ Select the verifiers (delegates) - A verifier is an expert who is able to assess from measurement data that the benefits are realized

Access control
> Some actions can only be triggered if you have the right role (DAO member, verifier..Etc)

NFT
> mint NFT to assess the realized benefits. These benefits can grow over time (e.g.: trees plantation)
+ The newly minted NFT can be traded immediately on the NFT marketplace, however it will have a lesser value if sold then. If the holder waits for the NFT to have the regenerative action measured and verified to have happened then there will be greater value (assuming this is something that the market cares about). As the NFT exists more benefits from the regenerative action are able to be recorded into the NFT, giving it further value over time. This value comes from the ability of organizations/ individuals to use it to offset their environmental footprint by buying and burning it.  

Regenerative NFT marketplace
> Oracles to fetch offchain data (benefits measurement)
+ Can use decentralized oracle network (e.g.: Chainlink)
