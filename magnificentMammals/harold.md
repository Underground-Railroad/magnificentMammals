*`In addition to the matrilineal Ayatian language, cosmology iconography, this script was specifically designed by female councils, to survive the West African slave trade, it can be found on both sides of the Atlantic.`*

We can see it further built into design in the indigenous modes of organization. We can see tools that aid modes of design in native & African protocols, like clan systems design in the Vodun cosmology, VeVe and Nsibidi scripts. The latter enabling built in tracking of value(s) flows that then wraps into core values of the collective. Even describing events and flows of generations! These visualizations of exchanges capture hidden capital even beyond the exchange of goods or services — simply coming together to meet and organize between plantations is dangerously valuable in both these historical & even some of today's circumstances.

*`Value(s) tracking can take beautiful forms.`*

*`While sustaining still more beautiful functions in long term complex dynamics!`*

*`This tracks value(s) flows across important events, and generations.`*

*`This is not African, But Arawak. Ayizan velekete — Organization, Mastery, Creativity. Most of the Veve are Arawak and very important to modes across Caribbean & South America’s displaced Native & African Nations. Ayizan is 1/7 in the African Ayatian clan system.`*

Tracking the emotions behind exchanges and or important intrinsic motivations also becomes important for clarity and connection to the past, present & future. This gives a strong collective cohesiveness for long term sustainability, even without considering trade networks, skills sharing, agreements or decisions etc. We learn from this history, that commons when managed properly, after accurate collective assessment based on tracking of value(s) flows, are key pieces to an incentive design anchored in freedom. Even when severely limited by brutal overarching circumstances.

The Stacks ecosystem dev tools and even the underlying technology stack were designed with the digital equivalents of autonomy in property value & even dev labor & expressive value(s) in mind. And with an adequate social layer we can sustainably extend this into labor, expressive and ecological value(s) flow across disciplines in the Stacks ecosystem. We can even design accessibility to commons for lay folks on the ground in the severe circumstances of today.

With Vevè pictured above, we see one part of a seven clan design theme, we also see indigenous science constants guiding meta clan structures for decentralized scalability. But the cosmologies also include infinite creases between the constants to avoid strict dogma. Note even modularity in the clan system design, as the Kanienke’ha’ka Five Nations have a three clan system, showing means to extend design if needed for autonomy & cultural identity preservation. Avoiding contamination of top down coercion, interference or even “the perception of corruption.”

on ***Interference :***

***Interference*** in an autonomous nation’s affairs inherently removes peaceful dialogue potential by violating autonomy. So not only do Native protocols for peaceful dialogue establish bidirectional flow design, they take it a step further to ensure this flow is genuinely without  *interference* ! *Satetionkwate* is the Kanienkahaka term for “we are all the same height” – the original US concepts of “we the people” or “United People;” and its language extended autonomy to all strains of life. Protecting design for bidirectional flows to ecosystems.
