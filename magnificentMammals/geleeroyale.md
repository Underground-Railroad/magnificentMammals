+ [Bridging Digital Communities](https://giveth.io/project/Bridging-Digital-Communities-1)

I run a bridge server for chats (Discord, Telegram, Riot, ...) and am actively engaging communities connected to the Ethereum space. Especially with the advent of newDAOs my services are being requested on a regular basis. Most requested at the moment is bridging between community servers on Discord (both communities get to share a room), whereas before it was mostly mirroring rooms between different protocols. Once a bridge is up, it still needs to be maintained and I regularly check that everything is in working order. I never charge for these services, but I do accept donations (all Ethereum tokens) Current list of bridged communities:
